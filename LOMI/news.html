            <p>Woods Hole Immunoparasitology Conference is starting Sunday 4/11 and is virtual this year.
              Our lab has always enjoyed participating in sharing our data and viewing other projects from brilliant people in the field.
              Go to this <a href="http://burkclients.com/WHIP/meetings/2021/site/team-members.html" target="_blank">link</a> for more information.</p>

            <p>We have been having some great rotation students and we have gotten one more!
              <a href="currentRotationStudents.html#currentRotationStudent1" target="_blank">Kevin Mears</a> is doing his 3rd rotation in our lab.
              He is a graduate student in CAMB with a MVP (Microbiology, Virology, Parasitology) focus.
              His work during this rotation will investigate type 1 immune responses of toxoplasma in some of our mouse models.</p>

            <p>We are happy to welcome another member to the Herbert Lab!
              <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember13" target="_blank">Lucas Ethgen</a> is our newest technician.
              He has experience as a volunteer in a clinic setting and as an EMT.
              He is looking to do some research while he prepares to apply for med school.</p>

            <p>We have a new review publication in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology!
              It is titled “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1081120620311443?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Tuft cells in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and asthma</a>.”

            <p>Progress is developing rapidly for a model crucial to <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember10" target="_blank">Evonne</a>‘s thesis work.
              She has developed a model that will look at the damage worms make when entering the skin barrier and the immediate responses that the immune system and neurons contribute.</p>

            <p>We have another IGG rotation student in our lab, we are currently the home for <a href="formerGraduateRotationStudents.html#formerRotationStudent1" target="_blank">Montserrat Arreguin</a> for her second rotation.
              She will be working with a few different people in lab who are working on neuroimmunology projects.</p>

            <p>Our new Postdoc <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember5" target="_blank">Juan</a> has recently been working on a project with <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> which is not new for De’Broski as a researcher but new for the nab here at Penn.
              Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsA8yiwC3nM&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">youtube video</a> showing S. mansoni on the skin.</p>

            <p>We would like to welcome another new member to the lab: <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember6" target="_blank">Heather Rossi PhD</a>.
              She comes to us from a fellow collaborator at Penn Ishmail Abdus-Saboor.
              She will help us get projects in that collaboration established, as well as take on some lab manager duties.
              Welcome Heather!</p>

            <p>So many interesting and new models and techniques are being developed in our lab these days.
              PhD candidate <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember9" target="_blank">Jay Ortiz</a> has made great progress and started up his own new model using fungal allergens to study the nasal epithelium.</p>

            <p>It’s a new year and the Herbert lab has established our goals/resolutions! We plan to be publishing a lot this year (hopefully some new projects) and continue to garner funding for our group of great scientists!</p>

              She has chosen to do her first rotation of grad school with us and will be working hard the next few months!</p>

            <p>Penn’s Fall Research Resumption plan is now in effect.
              We are continuing to remain socially distant while in lab and most members of the lab are fully hitting the ground running with their projects.
              We have exciting new collaborations with labs we haven’t worked with before as well as new projects starting up by hopeful graduate students.</p>

            <p>The Herbert Lab is welcoming another new member!
              <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember7" target="_blank">Olivia Lenz DVM</a> has joined the lab in this Fall as a Postdoctoral Fellow after graduating from the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine earlier in the year.
              She is working in both the Herbert and Lennon labs.</p>

            <p>Officially joining the lab as part of their thesis training in Penn’s IGG program is former rotation student <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember10" target="_blank">Evonne Jean</a>!
              We are excited to have them start their work in lab and they are starting up an exciting collaboration with Ishmail Abdus-Saboor’s lab who will serve as Evonne’s co-mentor.</p>

            <p>The Herbert lab has officially entered Penn’s Phase 2 for the resumption of research.
              We are now at about 50% capacity at any given hour in the lab.
              We are getting anxious and starting to produce some data again!</p>

            <p>A former member of the lab has some exciting news, <a href="formerSummerTeamMembers.html#formerSummerTeamMember7" target="_blank">Rachel Cohen</a> has decided to matriculate into the University of Colorado Anschutz’s Medical Scientist Training Program to pursue her MD-PhD!</p>

            <p>Officially joining the Herbert lab is another grad student but familiar face in <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember11" target="_blank">Annabel Ferguson</a>!
              Her project will focus on host pressures on helminth selection and parasite gene expression.</p>

            <p>The Herbert lab has officially entered Penn’s Phase 1 for the resumption of research.
              We may only be at 20% capacity at any given hour in the lab, but we are making the most of this invaluable lab time after all this writing and planning!</p>

            <p>Officially joining the lab as part of his thesis training in Penn’s IGG program is former rotation student <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember9" target="_blank">Jay Ortiz</a>!
              We are excited to have him hit the ground running!</p>

            <p>We in the Herbert Lab hope that everyone is staying safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.
              Though we are not doing any wet lab work, we are all working hard from home on data analyzation, manuscript editing/preparation, and grant writing!</p>

            <p>She did it!
              <a href="formerTeamMembers.html#formerTeamMember1" target="_blank">Kelly Zullo</a>  is now Doctor Kelly Zullo Ph.D. Immunology!
