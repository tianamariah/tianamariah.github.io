            <h2>Research Statement</h2>
            <p>The over-arching goal of my research program is to use parasitic organisms as a guide to investigate basic mechanisms of host immunity, inflammation and wound healing. I have been continuously NIH-R01 funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2007 and have authored 55 manuscripts published in journals that include: Science, Science Immunology, Nature Medicine, Nature Communications, Immunity, JEM, PNAS, PLoS Pathogens, and the Journal of Immunology. Most of this work has focused on the immune response to parasitic helminths, organisms that are the likely evolutionary driving force for Type 2 immunity. Helminths are a major cause of disease in impoverished populations (~2-3 billion people) and biomedical research focused on parasitic helminths has been a fertile ground for scientific discovery.
  	        Helminths such as hookworms pose a formidable challenge to the host immune system regarding their large size, morphological complexity and the host tissue niches they occupy. While infectious larval stages can cause tremendous damage to host tissues as they invade and migrate, the hematophagous nature of adult stages can cause persistent injury during feeding. Surprisingly, most helminth species can survive for years, even decades in their hosts due to a variety of mechanisms including those that suppress and evade host immunity. Given this complex biology, research projects based in my lab (and most collaborative work) focus on the mechanisms that initiate Type 2 responses, those that drive tissue repair, and requirements for host protective immunity at the sites where worms invade and reside (e.g., skin, respiratory tract, and intestine). Given the widely held notion that allergic inflammation is due to maladaptive Type 2 responses that initially evolved to deal with helminths, our work has broad relevance to both infectious and non-infectious disease. Below is an overview of the research topics covered by my laboratory, including key collaborative projects depicted in Figure “Research topics”

              <p>Due to an inherent fascination with parasitic helminthes, De’Broski R. Herbert earned a B.S. in Microbiology from Xavier University of Louisiana (1994) and a Ph.D. in Immunology from Thomas Jefferson Medical College (2000). His thesis work demonstrated a critical role for IL-5, B-1 lymphocytes, and eosinophils in host-protective immunity against Strongyloides stercoralis (J Immunol. 2000 Oct 15;165(8):4544-51).<br><br>

                  As part of a life-long dream, De’Broski spent several years in South Africa to complete his post-doctoral training at the University of Cape Town in the laboratory of Frank Brombacher Ph.D. This resulted in seminal work that demonstrated IL-4/IL-13-driven alternative macrophage activation controls lethal immunopathology during Schistosoma mansoni infection (Immunity. 2004 May;20 (5):623-35).<br><br>

                  Subsequently, he joined the laboratory of Fred. D. Finkelman M.D. and published multiple studies focused on the importance of IL-4/IL-13 in driving host-protection against parasitic helminthes through direct regulation of tissue macrophage function (J Immunol. 2010 Jun 1;184(11):6438-46) and mucosal epithelia (J Exp Med. 2009 Dec 21;206(13):2947-57).<br><br>

                  As principal investigator of his independent laboratory at Cincinnati Children’s Research Foundation, his work focused upon elucidating mechanisms of innate Type 2 cytokine regulation by Trefoil factor family proteins (J Exp Med. 2012 Mar 12;209 (3):607-22) and immunosuppressivemacrophage subsets in the context of helminth infection and allergic inflammation (Eur J Immunol. 2011 Jul;41(7):2000-9,
                  Am J Pathol. 2012 May;180(5):2001-8).<br><br>

                  Currently positioned as associate professor of Infectious Immunology in the Department of Pathobiology at UPENN, his laboratory is investigating mechanisms of host protection against helminthes, Type 2 inflammation, and the resolution of chronic mucosal inflammation in several model systems.<br><br>

              <p>Li-Yin is a research associate who received her Ph.D. in Immunology at UC Davis before joining Herbert lab.<br>
                 Her primary interest is in the interaction between immune cells and epithelia in the airway. Li-Yin’s work focused on how immune cells and soluble factors derived from them, such as Trefoil Factors, can promote pulmonary tissue repair after infectious and/or non-infectious insults. <br><br>
                 In 2016 Li-Yin decided to take on an exciting opportunity and moved with the lab to Penn. Since then her work also expanded to areas related to lung progenitor cells and how Trefoil factors fit into the big picture of pulmonary regeneration.<br><br>
                 When not at work, Li-Yin likes reading, hiking, bouldering and spending time with her cat Kallisto. She is also an avid baseball fan who is always down for going to a ball game.

              <p>Heather Rossi is a research associate who received her Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Florida in 2008. In 2021 by way of collaborative exchange, she joined the Herbert lab to bring new expertise in pain and sensory processing. She helps us to better understand how pain-sensing neurons called “nociceptors” detect invasion and damage, communicate with the cells of the immune system to respond to these threats and contribute to resolution when the threat has passed.  Of particular interest are the potential direct interactions between parasites, which are able to get into the body with little awareness from the host, and the nociceptors monitoring tissue for external threats. Heather also brings additional skills in scientific writing and editing to help the lab achieve their funding and publication goals.

              <p>Chris comes to Penn after spending his undergraduate years at the University of Pittsburgh where he studied Microbiology.  He has previously looked at the microbiome of some of the Lingo receptor knockout mice as well as re-developed multiple allergy models for the lab. He shifts around helping multiple projects such as work on cellular sources of IL-33, and culturing human macrophages. He currently heads a project looking at helminth-infected humans and levels of trefoils.<br><br>

              <h5>Updates on My Projects</h5>

              <p>My main project in lab involves studying global human immune responses to helminths in collaboration with the Nigerian Institute for Medical Research. This includes working with some human patient samples from our collaborators. The samples are from school aged children who are either infected or uninfected with different helminths. This work has also led me to some cell culture work with a human macrophage line to look at myeloid cytokine responses.</p>
              <p>I am also working a project that looks at the role of cell-specific IL-33 in the context of colitis or in the context of a <em>Nippostrongylus</em> infection.</p>
              <p>In the past I have collaborated with <a href="https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/DANIELBEITING" target="_blank">Dan Beiting</a> of Penn to develop a microbiome profile of some of our mice. He has a great blog that I was able to utilize to help a somewhat inexperienced coder along the process of using some of the software required to generate this data. The link to his blog can be found here: <a href="https://hostmicrobe.org/microbiome/cloudComputing_part1/" target="_blank">Cloud computing for metagenomics – Part I</a></p>
              <p>I have re-established allergy models for papain and house dust mite (HDM) for the lab.  The lab has a few outlets potentially into lung epithelium and currently we run a core that measures lung functionality.</p>
