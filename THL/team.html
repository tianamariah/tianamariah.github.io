            <h1>De’Broski R. Herbert, PhD</h1>
            <p>Due to an inherent fascination with parasitic helminths, De’Broski R. Herbert earned a B.S. in
              Microbiology from Xavier University of Louisiana (1994) and a Ph.D.in Immunology from Thomas Jefferson
              Medical College (2000). His thesis work demonstrated a critical role for IL-5, B-1 lymphocytes, and
              eosinophils in host-protective immunity against <em>Strongyloides stercoralis</em> (J Immunol. 2000 Oct
              15;165(8):4544-51).</p>
            <p>As part of a life-long dream, De’Broski spent several years in South Africa to complete his post-doctoral
              training at the University of Cape Town in the laboratory of Frank Brombacher Ph.D. This resulted in
              seminal work that demonstrated IL-4/IL-13-driven alternative macrophage activation controls lethal
              immunopathology during <em>Schistosoma mansoni infection</em> (Immunity. 2004 May;20 (5):623-35).</p>
            <p>Subsequently, he joined the laboratory of Fred. D. Finkelman M.D. and published multiple studies focused
              on the importance of IL-4/IL-13 in driving host-protection against parasitic helminthes through direct
              regulation of tissue macrophage function (J Immunol. 2010 Jun 1;184(11):6438-46) and mucosal epithelia (J
              Exp Med. 2009 Dec 21;206(13):2947-57).</p>
            <p>As principal investigator of his independent laboratory at Cincinnati Children’s Research Foundation, his
              work focused upon elucidating mechanisms of innate Type 2 cytokine regulation by Trefoil factor family
              proteins (J Exp Med. 2012 Mar 12;209 (3):607-22) and immunosuppressivemacrophage subsets in the context of
              helminth infection and allergic inflammation (Eur J Immunol. 2011 Jul;41(7):2000-9,
              Am J Pathol. 2012 May;180(5):2001-8).</p>
            <p>Currently positioned as associate professor of Infectious Immunology in the Department of Pathobiology at
              UPENN, his laboratory is investigating mechanisms of host protection against helminthes, Type 2
              inflammation, and the resolution of chronic mucosal inflammation in several model systems.</p>

            <h1>Heather Rossi, PhD</h1>
            <p>Heather Rossi is a research associate who received her Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of
              Florida in 2008. In 2021 by way of collaborative exchange, she joined the Herbert lab to bring new
              expertise in pain and sensory processing. She helps us to better understand how pain-sensing neurons
              called “nociceptors” detect invasion and damage, communicate with the cells of the immune system to
              respond to these threats and contribute to resolution when the threat has passed. Of particular interest
              are the potential direct interactions between parasites, which are able to get into the body with little
              awareness from the host, and the nociceptors monitoring tissue for external threats. Heather also brings
              additional skills in scientific writing and editing to help the lab achieve their funding and publication
              goals.</p>
            <p><strong>Where are you from?</strong><br>Heather moved a lot when she was growing up. She's lived in seven
              states
              in the US (TN, PA, NJ, GA, NC, FL, and IA) plus one other country (Okinawa, Japan)</p>
            <p><strong>What is your favorite hangout place or favorite thing to do?</strong><br>Heather enjoys exploring
              art museums and festivals, going to live concerts (recent favorites were Muse and Radiohead), and hanging
              at home doing yoga and puzzles with her cats, Bernard and Clayton</p>

            <p><strong>What is your career aspiration?</strong><br>To come to a more wholistic understanding of how pain

            <p>Li-Yin is a research associate who received her Ph.D. in Immunology at UC Davis before joining Herbert
              lab. Her primary interest is in the interaction between immune cells and epithelia in the airway. Li-Yin’s
              work focused on how immune cells and soluble factors derived from them, such as Trefoil Factors, can
              promote pulmonary tissue repair after infectious and/or non-infectious insults.</p>
            <p>In 2016 Li-Yin decided to take on an exciting opportunity and moved with the lab to Penn. Since then her
              work also expanded to areas related to lung progenitor cells and how Trefoil factors fit into the big
              picture of pulmonary regeneration.</p>

            <p>My main project in lab involves studying global human immune responses to helminths in collaboration with
              the Nigerian Institute for Medical Research. This includes working with some human patient samples from
              our collaborators. The samples are from school aged children who are either infected or uninfected with
              different helminths. This work has also led me to some cell culture work with a human macrophage line to
              look at myeloid cytokine responses.</p>
            <p>I am also working a project that looks at the role of cell-specific IL-33 in the context of colitis or in
              the context of a <em>Nippostrongylus</em> infection.</p>
