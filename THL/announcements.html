                 He is a graduate student in CAMB with a MVP (Microbiology, Virology, Parasitology) focus.
                 His work during this rotation will investigate type 1 immune responses of toxoplasma in some of our mouse models.

                 Progress is developing rapidly for a model crucial to Evonne‘s thesis work.
                 She has developed a model that will look at the damage worms make when entering the skin barrier and the immediate responses that the immune system and neurons contribute.

              We have been having some great rotation students and we have gotten one more!
              Kevin Mears is doing his 3rd rotation in our lab.
              He is a graduate student in CAMB with a MVP (Microbiology, Virology, Parasitology) focus.
              His work during this rotation will investigate type 1 immune responses of toxoplasma in some of our mouse models.

              We are happy to welcome another member to the Herbert Lab!
              Lucas Ethgen is our newest technician.
              He has experience as a volunteer in a clinic setting and as an EMT.
              He is looking to do some research while he prepares to apply for med school.

              We have a new review publication in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology!
              It is titled “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1081120620311443?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" aria-label="Read the full publication on Science Direct">Tuft cells in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and asthma</a>.”
              The worked was led by Elizabeth Sell of close collaborator Noam Cohen’s group as well as our own Jay Ortiz.

              Progress is developing rapidly for a model crucial to Evonne‘s thesis work.
              She has developed a model that will look at the damage worms make when entering the skin barrier and the immediate responses that the immune system and neurons contribute.

              Our new Postdoc Juan has recently been working on a project with <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> which is not new for De’Broski as a researcher but new for the nab here at Penn.
              Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsA8yiwC3nM&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" aria-label="Watch Juan's project on Schistosoma mansoni on Youtube">youtube video</a> showing S. mansoni on the skin.

              We would like to welcome another new member to the lab: Heather Rossi PhD.
              She comes to us from a fellow collaborator at Penn Ishmail Abdus-Saboor.
              She will help us get projects in that collaboration established, as well as take on some lab manager duties.
              Welcome Heather!

             So many interesting and new models and techniques are being developed in our lab these days.
             PhD candidate Jay Ortiz has made great progress and started up his own new model using fungal allergens to study the nasal epithelium.
