             <p>Woods Hole Immunoparasitology Conference is starting Sunday 4/11 and is virtual this year.
             Our lab has always enjoyed participating in sharing our data and viewing other projects from brilliant people in the field.
             Go to this <a href="http://burkclients.com/WHIP/meetings/2021/site/team-members.html" target="_blank">link</a> for more information.</p>

           <li>
             <p>We have been having some great rotation students and we have gotten one more!
             <a href="currentRotationStudents.html#currentRotationStudent1" target="_blank">Kevin Mears</a> is doing his 3rd rotation in our lab.
             He is a graduate student in CAMB with a MVP (Microbiology, Virology, Parasitology) focus.
             His work during this rotation will investigate type 1 immune responses of toxoplasma in some of our mouse models.</p>
           </li>

           <li>
             <p>We are happy to welcome another member to the Herbert Lab!
             <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember13" target="_blank">Lucas Ethgen</a> is our newest technician.
             He has experience as a volunteer in a clinic setting and as an EMT.
             He is looking to do some research while he prepares to apply for med school.</p>
           </li>

           <li>
             <p>We have a new review publication in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology!
             It is titled ‚Äú<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1081120620311443?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Tuft cells in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and asthma</a>.‚Äù
             The worked was led by Elizabeth Sell of close collaborator Noam Cohen‚Äôs group as well as our own <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember9" target="_blank">Jay Ortiz</a>.</p>
           </li>

           <li>
             <p>Progress is developing rapidly for a model crucial to <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember10" target="_blank">Evonne</a>‚Äòs thesis work.
             She has developed a model that will look at the damage worms make when entering the skin barrier and the immediate responses that the immune system and neurons contribute.</p>
           </li>

           <li>
             <p>We have another IGG rotation student in our lab, we are currently the home for <a href="formerGraduateRotationStudents.html#formerRotationStudent1" target="_blank">Montserrat Arreguin</a> for her second rotation.
             She will be working with a few different people in lab who are working on neuroimmunology projects.</p>
           </li>

           <li>
             <p>Our new Postdoc <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember5" target="_blank">Juan</a> has recently been working on a project with <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> which is not new for De‚ÄôBroski as a researcher but new for the nab here at Penn.
             Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsA8yiwC3nM&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">youtube video</a> showing S. mansoni on the skin.</p>
           </li>

           <li>
             <p>We would like to welcome another new member to the lab: <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember6" target="_blank">Heather Rossi PhD</a>.
               She comes to us from a fellow collaborator at Penn Ishmail Abdus-Saboor.
               She will help us get projects in that collaboration established, as well as take on some lab manager duties.
               Welcome Heather!</p>
            </li>

          <li>
            <p>So many interesting and new models and techniques are being developed in our lab these days.
             PhD candidate <a href="team-members.html#currentTeamMember9" target="_blank">Jay Ortiz</a> has made great progress and started up his own new model using fungal allergens to study the nasal epithelium.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
           <p>It‚Äôs a new year and the Herbert lab has established our goals/resolutions! We plan to be publishing a lot this year (hopefully some new projects) and continue to garner funding for our group of great scientists!</p>
