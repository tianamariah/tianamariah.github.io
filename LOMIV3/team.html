             <h1>De’Broski R. Herbert, PhD</h1>
             <p>Due to an inherent fascination with parasitic helminthes, De’Broski R. Herbert earned a B.S. in Microbiology from Xavier University of Louisiana (1994) and a Ph.D.in Immunology from Thomas Jefferson Medical College (2000). His thesis work demonstrated a critical role for IL-5, B-1 lymphocytes, and eosinophils in host-protective immunity against Strongyloides stercoralis (J Immunol. 2000 Oct 15;165(8):4544-51).</p>
             <p>As part of a life-long dream, De’Broski spent several years in South Africa to complete his post-doctoral training at the University of Cape Town in the laboratory of Frank Brombacher Ph.D. This resulted in seminal work that demonstrated IL-4/IL-13-driven alternative macrophage activation controls lethal immunopathology during Schistosoma mansoni infection (Immunity. 2004 May;20 (5):623-35).</p>
             <p>Subsequently, he joined the laboratory of Fred. D. Finkelman M.D. and published multiple studies focused on the importance of IL-4/IL-13 in driving host-protection against parasitic helminthes through direct regulation of tissue macrophage function (J Immunol. 2010 Jun 1;184(11):6438-46) and mucosal epithelia (J Exp Med. 2009 Dec 21;206(13):2947-57).</p>
             <p>As principal investigator of his independent laboratory at Cincinnati Children’s Research Foundation, his work focused upon elucidating mechanisms of innate Type 2 cytokine regulation by Trefoil factor family proteins (J Exp Med. 2012 Mar 12;209 (3):607-22) and immunosuppressivemacrophage subsets in the context of helminth infection and allergic inflammation (Eur J Immunol. 2011 Jul;41(7):2000-9,
                 Am J Pathol. 2012 May;180(5):2001-8).</p>
             <p>Currently positioned as associate professor of Infectious Immunology in the Department of Pathobiology at UPENN, his laboratory is investigating mechanisms of host protection against helminthes, Type 2 inflammation, and the resolution of chronic mucosal inflammation in several model systems.</p>

             <h1>Heather Rossi, PhD</h1>
             <p>Heather Rossi is a research associate who received her Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Florida in 2008. In 2021 by way of collaborative exchange, she joined the Herbert lab to bring new expertise in pain and sensory processing. She helps us to better understand how pain-sensing neurons called “nociceptors” detect invasion and damage, communicate with the cells of the immune system to respond to these threats and contribute to resolution when the threat has passed.  Of particular interest are the potential direct interactions between parasites, which are able to get into the body with little awareness from the host, and the nociceptors monitoring tissue for external threats. Heather also brings additional skills in scientific writing and editing to help the lab achieve their funding and publication goals.</p>

             <h3>Updates on My Projects</h3>

             <p>My main project in lab involves studying global human immune responses to helminths in collaboration with the Nigerian Institute for Medical Research. This includes working with some human patient samples from our collaborators. The samples are from school aged children who are either infected or uninfected with different helminths. This work has also led me to some cell culture work with a human macrophage line to look at myeloid cytokine responses.</p>
             <p>I am also working a project that looks at the role of cell-specific IL-33 in the context of colitis or in the context of a <em>Nippostrongylus</em> infection.</p>
             <p>In the past I have collaborated with <a href="https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/DANIELBEITING" target="_blank">Dan Beiting</a> of Penn to develop a microbiome profile of some of our mice. He has a great blog that I was able to utilize to help a somewhat inexperienced coder along the process of using some of the software required to generate this data. The link to his blog can be found here: <a href="https://hostmicrobe.org/microbiome/cloudComputing_part1/" target="_blank">Cloud computing for metagenomics – Part I</a></p>
             <p>I have re-established allergy models for papain and house dust mite (HDM) for the lab.  The lab has a few outlets potentially into lung epithelium and currently we run a core that measures lung functionality.</p>
