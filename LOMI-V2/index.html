              <p>Due to an inherent fascination with parasitic helminthes, De’Broski R. Herbert earned a B.S. in Microbiology from Xavier University of Louisiana (1994) and a Ph.D.in Immunology from Thomas Jefferson Medical College (2000). His thesis work demonstrated a critical role for IL-5, B-1 lymphocytes, and eosinophils in host-protective immunity against Strongyloides stercoralis (J Immunol. 2000 Oct 15;165(8):4544-51).</p>
              <p>As part of a life-long dream, De’Broski spent several years in South Africa to complete his post-doctoral training at the University of Cape Town in the laboratory of Frank Brombacher Ph.D. This resulted in seminal work that demonstrated IL-4/IL-13-driven alternative macrophage activation controls lethal immunopathology during Schistosoma mansoni infection (Immunity. 2004 May;20 (5):623-35).</p>
              <p>Subsequently, he joined the laboratory of Fred. D.

                  <p>Li-Yin is a research associate who received her Ph.D. in Immunology at UC Davis before joining Herbert lab. Her primary interest is in the interaction between immune cells and epithelia in the airway. Li-Yin’s work focused on how immune cells and soluble factors derived from them, such as Trefoil Factors, can promote pulmonary tissue repair after infectious and/or non-infectious insults.</p>
                  <p>In 2016 Li-Yin decided to take on an exciting opportunity and moved with the lab to Penn. Since then her work also expanded to areas related to lung progenitor cells and how Trefoil factors fit into the big picture of pulmonary regeneration.</p>

                  <p>Heather Rossi is a research associate who received her Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Florida in 2008. In 2021 by way of collaborative exchange, she joined the Herbert lab to bring new expertise in pain and sensory processing. She helps us to better understand how pain-sensing neurons called “nociceptors” detect invasion and damage, communicate with the cells of the immune system to respond to these threats and contribute to resolution when the threat has passed.  Of particular interest are the potential direct interactions between parasites, which are able to get into the body with little awareness from the host, and the nociceptors monitoring tissue for external threats. Heather also brings additional skills in scientific writing and editing to help the lab achieve their funding and publication goals.</p>
                  <p><strong>Where are you from?</strong><br>I moved a lot when I was growing up. I’ve lived in seven states in the US (TN, PA, NJ, GA, NC, FL, and IA) and one other country (Okinawa, Japan)</p>
                  <p><strong>What is your favorite hangout place or favorite thing to do?</strong><br>Heather enjoys exploring art museums and festivals, going to live concerts (recent favorites were Muse and Radiohead), and hanging at home doing yoga and puzzles with her cats, Bernard and Clayton</p>

                  <p>Chris comes to Penn after spending his undergraduate years at the University of Pittsburgh where he studied Microbiology.  He has previously looked at the microbiome of some of the Lingo receptor knockout mice as well as re-developed multiple allergy models for the lab. He shifts around helping multiple projects such as work on cellular sources of IL-33, and culturing human macrophages. He currently heads a project looking at helminth-infected humans and levels of trefoils.</p>

                  <h5>Updates on My Projects</h5>

                  <p>My main project in lab involves studying global human immune responses to helminths in collaboration with the Nigerian Institute for Medical Research. This includes working with some human patient samples from our collaborators. The samples are from school aged children who are either infected or uninfected with different helminths. This work has also led me to some cell culture work with a human macrophage line to look at myeloid cytokine responses.</p>
                  <p>I am also working a project that looks at the role of cell-specific IL-33 in the context of colitis or in the context of a <em>Nippostrongylus</em> infection.</p>
                  <p>In the past I have collaborated with <a href="https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/DANIELBEITING" target="_blank">Dan Beiting</a> of Penn to develop a microbiome profile of some of our mice. He has a great blog that I was able to utilize to help a somewhat inexperienced coder along the process of using some of the software required to generate this data. The link to his blog can be found here: <a href="https://hostmicrobe.org/microbiome/cloudComputing_part1/" target="_blank">Cloud computing for metagenomics – Part I</a></p>
                  <p>I have re-established allergy models for papain and house dust mite (HDM) for the lab.  The lab has a few outlets potentially into lung epithelium and currently we run a core that measures lung functionality.</p>

                  <p>Jay is a Ph.D. student at Penn in the Immunology Graduate Group (IGG) Program. He is primarily interested in understanding the role of rare epithelial cell subsets such as tuft cells in the upper and lower airways as initiators of type 2 immune responses to aeroallergens and in the context of chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and allergic asthma. His work in the Herbert lab will be focused on dissecting type 2 immune circuits involving sinonasal tuft cells and trigeminal sensory neurons in models of allergic inflammation.</p>
                  <p>Jay has been selected as a Co-Director for the Immunology Graduate Student Association (IGA) Board for the 2020-2021 school year.</p>

It is a trainee-led coalition advocating for scientists and physicians historically marginalized and excluded in STEM across all degree and professional levels. We strive to create inclusive platforms, advocating for and implementing initiatives to empower individuals at the margins of Academia, with diverse gender identities, backgrounds, ethnicities, and sexual orientations. We are dedicated to expanding opportunities for current graduate and medical students, as well as postdoctoral fellows in the Penn community through outreach, fundraising, entrepreneurship, and media engagement initiatives.
