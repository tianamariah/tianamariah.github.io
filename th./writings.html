            pleasure over matter the way we fleeted to other lands.</br>
            we drifted off </br>
            time and time again. </br>
            too many times </br>
            to understand. </br>
            we once had things in common.</br>
            shared rhythm and blues</br>
            and now tonight </br>
          <span class="collapse wCollapse wCollapse1">
            you stumbling upon my stoop.</br>
            been so long since these golden eyes have seen you.</br>
            dust still settling from your world i shook. </br>
            sweet nostalgic moments but i don't want to look.</br>
            every second was so precious then </br>
            laughing on a strawberry swing.</br>
            you used to touch me nicely</br>
            and take me to orgasm.</br>
            we used to be like minded</br>
            and your bed was always warm.</br>
            i'd look at you with a heady mind of sunset skies</br>
            and joy rides</br>
            to park the ride in a dark night</br>
            to have sex under moonlight</br>
            but that ended up in lovecrimes.

            feelings changed.</br>
            couldn't ignore how ritualistic it became.</br>
            eyes wandered in search of fling</br>
            or maybe something that just made me feel something</br>
            cuz with you i felt nothing.</br>

            wanting to know</br>
            why things ended and why i had to let go.</br>
            there will be tears from the frown in your smile</br>

            and we move together, logic overthrown</br>
            i allow IT to be possible</br>
            i want this so badly and madly</br>

            i've found little pieces of myself.</br>

            it feels good to finally feel good. to finally have appreciation.</br>
            i wouldn't change my history.</br>
            those are the pages that made me.</br>

My beautiful angel whom I find solace in. Yet no safe haven is safe enough when there’s destruction happening from the inside out. Only I can heal the things happening inside of me. I can search to YOU for emotional support and I can vent to YOU all day long but I still need healing. My healing must come from myself. Lifestyle changes. </p>

        <p>
          I plan on staying alive for quite some time so with that being said, will we curve and bend to fit every trend? If so and when this does happen would we reach our end? Love is an interesting feeling: So permanent and fleeting. So vague and so uplifting with no concept of timing. I’d love to one day be a wife but I cannot comprehend the thought of life with just one. Many reasons why love turns to goodbye. My heart screams and cries in fear of losing this one. Don’t know what I’d do without this one.<span class="collapse wCollapse wCollapse7"> But the thought of living happily in love seems so illogical. How could one yearn continual? What I know for sure is what I’m feeling right now is the surest thing I’ve ever known. But emotions flow straight from high to low. The things you know sometimes change. It’s so strange. Things change everyday and I need this right here to stay. The best bet is to take it one day at a time. Let things fall as they rise. Let us enjoy the ride. As I look into your eyes and I hope this moment never dies.

          I just want resolution. It bothers me that you’re so deep in my mind, so constantly there, that even when I’m sleeping I’m thinking of you. I hugged you with the purest of intentions. I know this is what I want in waking life too. But I can’t force you to feel the same. I don’t even know how you feel.

            When I saw you Saturday, we smiled at each other for the first time in a long time. You asked me a question. You got my attention to say goodbye when you were ready to leave. You touched me and it felt good. I felt something. Maybe my shoulders were just tense when you rested your hand there. Were you able to sense the depths of my emotions when you caressed me in that moment? Did I give myself away? Do you now know all my secrets?
          </p>
          <p>
            All I want is to hug one time and call it a truce. End the war between us as well as the war in my mind. What’s done is done but I know it just couldn’t be that easy. But maybe it could be. It can honestly be whatever we want it to be so let’s just make peace. It’s the right thing to do.

          At 5pm. During a winter sunset. Pink skies and not one cloud. Them palm trees go so high while we both get so high. Rollin up to celebrate the good life. We’ve found the light. Felt like an eternity of hell but here we are. Been forever since things felt this good. Been forever since I seen you really smile. Yea, it’s been a while. At 5pm during a winter sunset on the west coast. Watch the ocean glow. Talking 65 degrees in the middle of January. The way it’s so hot in the sun. In the shade, chilly. All the ways. We’ve found the light. We’ve been so stressed lately. But finally! We got what I’ve been asking for. We got what our souls needed. We closed the door to the gloom. Made room for all we’ve been wishing. We found it. At 5pm. During a winter sunset.
